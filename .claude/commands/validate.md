# Validate Project

Run all pre-commit validation checks on the Lesca project.

## Steps

1. Run TypeScript type checking: `npm run typecheck`
2. Run ESLint: `npm run lint`
3. Run unit tests: `npm test`
4. Report any failures with specific file:line references

If any check fails, provide clear guidance on how to fix the issues.
