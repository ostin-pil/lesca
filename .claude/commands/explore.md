## Steps

1. Read the LLM knowledge base: `docs/LLM_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE.md`
2. Search for relevant implementations using Grep
3. Read the relevant source files
4. Provide a comprehensive explanation including:
   - How it works conceptually
   - Key files and their roles
   - Important interfaces/types
   - Code examples
   - How to extend or modify it

## Focus Areas

- Types are in `shared/types/src/index.ts`
