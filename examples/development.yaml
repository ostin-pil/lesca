# Notes:
# - Browser runs in visible mode - you'll see what it's doing
# - Debug logging enabled - very verbose output
# - Cache disabled - always fresh data
# - Sequential scraping - easier to follow
# - Long timeouts - good for slow connections/debugging
# - Output saved to ./debug-output
# - Logs saved to ./lesca-debug.log
